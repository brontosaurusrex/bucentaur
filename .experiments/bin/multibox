# multibox, writen by chatgpt 2023 with this prompt:
# "Can you write a bash script that would take any lenght multiline text as input and then draw rounded box around it and display that to the user"

# with explanation given:
# AI: This script uses the printf command to format the text so that it is left-aligned within the box. The %-${max_length}s format specifier is used to left-align the text and pad it with spaces as necessary to achieve the desired width.

# There was some human intervention.
# usage example:
# echo "woot\nwoot" | multibox
