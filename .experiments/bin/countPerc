# countPerc

# A simle countdown ZSH script that draws 
# progress bar using perc2 script
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/bucentaur/master/bin/perc2

# Usage: countPerc 20 # in seconds
# Note: This is NOT miliseconds precise.

second="0.99"
set +m
c="$1" ; d="$1"

perc=$(( 100.0/c ))

varcalc() {
    var="$(perc2 $(( 100 - perc * c )))"
}

repeat c {(( c-- )); sleep "$second" & ; varcalc; wait; echo -ne "$var\r" }
# wait before echo seems like a more natural way, however some time is lost here.

echo "$d seconds has passed."
